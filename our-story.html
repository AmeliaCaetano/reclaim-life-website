    <h2>The Heart Behind Reclaim Life Foundation</h2>
    <img src="mom-picture.jpg" alt="Mother Picture" class="left-img" />
    <p>I have started this foundation because of my personal experience in my mother's struggle. She was diagnosed with a common rectal cancer. She went through chemotherapy and radiation, which resulted in a permanent stoma.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="content-section">
    <p>I witnessed her pain, fear, and hesitation to open up about her condition, which made me realize how many others might be suffering in silence. I suffered from the emotional, financial, mental, and physical burdens caused by digestive system illnesses. My mother kept her illness a secret from all of us. I didn't know what she was going through until I decided to take action and find out for myself. I know I respected her privacy, but I also needed to understand her condition so I could provide the right support. The experience showed me how difficult it can be for people to share their struggles with their loved ones, and how important it is to create a safe space where individuals facing digestive health issues feel understood and supported.</p>

    <div class="quote">"Living with a stoma didn't end my life, it saved it."</div>

  </section>

  <section class="content-section">
    <p>I realized how difficult it is to manage the condition, the stigma surrounding them, and the ongoing need for medical aid and support. I chose to focus on digestive health disorders because they are life altering, often stigmatized, and financially draining for patients and their families. Many organizations focus primarily on digestive health research, but few provide direct support to their patients and their families who are struggling to manage these conditions. Living with a chronic or a permanent digestive condition is not easy. Many people lack the resources or knowledge to manage their condition properly, and I want to change that by creating a safe space where they can receive the education, the help, and the support they need.</p>

    <p>I want to ensure that no one has to struggle alone. This foundation is dedicated to providing hope and dignity to patients and families navigating these illnesses. I'm deeply rooted in compassion, care, and advocacy, working to improve lives through medical aid, emotional support, and awareness. We aim to improve lives beyond conditions, and heal the inside pain. We also help them to reclaim their life back, their hope, strength, and peace. Even after an illness, surgery, or pain, it's about helping people feel whole again.</p>
